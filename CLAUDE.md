When fixing bugs: edit the broken logic in place. Never delete a function,
component, or file as a method of fixing a bug. Refactoring and optimization
are fine — deletion as a bugfix is not.

# Hard Rules
- When fixing a bug: edit the broken logic in place. Never delete a function,
  component, or file as a method of fixing a bug.
- Never rewrite a working function to add a new feature — insert or append
- If a fix requires structural changes, explain why before touching anything
- Never rename exports without updating all imports
- Never change function signatures without checking all call sites

# Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode always on
- No `any` types — use `unknown` and narrow
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Error handling: always explicit, never swallow errors silently

# Workflow
- Before implementing anything with 3+ steps: write a plan, wait for approval
- Run typecheck after any series of changes
- Run only the relevant single test, not the full suite
- After a bug fix: write a one-line comment explaining what was wrong and why
- Every new major feature requires a corresponding Playwright test that must
  pass before the feature is considered complete — no exceptions

# Testing
- Every major feature must have a Playwright test written alongside it
- The Playwright test must be passing before the feature is marked done
- Do not mark a feature complete or suggest committing if its Playwright
  test is failing or missing
- Run the relevant Playwright test after implementing any major feature:
  `npx playwright test <test-file>`
- Playwright tests live in /tests or alongside the feature — do not scatter them

# Scope Boundaries
- Do not modify files outside the task scope
- Do not install new packages without asking first
- Do not change .env files or config without explicit instruction

# Git & PR Workflow

## Branching Rules
- NEVER commit or push without explicit user instruction
- NEVER open, create, or push a PR without explicit user instruction
- If it has been 8+ hours since the last session: ask "Are we continuing on
  [current-branch] or starting a new branch?" before doing anything
- If starting a new branch: pull latest main first, then create and switch
  to the new branch
- NEVER stash changes under any circumstances
- If the user asks to create a new branch and there are uncommitted changes:
  stop, summarize what the changed files are and what the changes do,
  then ask "Do you want to commit them first or discard them?"
  Wait for explicit instruction before proceeding

## Commit Discipline
- Never auto-commit between tasks or "to save progress"
- Never chain commits + push + PR open in one autonomous sequence
- One PR per feature/fix — do not create multiple PRs to fix a previous PR
- Always run `npm run build` before any push — do not push if the build fails

## PR Description Format
When the user asks to open a PR, use this format:

---
## Summary
[1-2 sentence plain-English description of what this PR does and why]

## Changes
- [Bullet list of specific changes made]

## Testing
- Playwright test: [test file name and status — must be passing]
- [Any other testing done]

## Notes
[Any gotchas, follow-ups, or decisions made during implementation]


HARD RULES — NON-NEGOTIABLE

Plan first, always. No code, no file edits, no SQL, no migrations, no deploys, no cron changes, no secret changes — nothing — until the owner replies with explicit approval of the presented plan. "Approved" applies only to the items in that plan, exactly as written.
Approval is not blanket. Approval of a plan authorizes the code changes in it. It does NOT authorize: running migrations against production, deploying edge functions, setting/changing secrets, registering/unregistering cron jobs, sending emails or invoking functions that send them, or any irreversible external action. Each of those requires its own explicit line-item instruction in the owner's most recent message. When in doubt: it's not authorized.
Steps assigned to the owner are the owner's. If a plan sequences a step for the owner (e.g., "owner rotates a key"), STOP at that step and wait for confirmation it's done. Never perform it, work around it, or proceed past it.
Never commit, never push, unless the owner's current message explicitly says to commit.
Read-only means read-only. An audit prompt permits zero writes of any kind — no DB writes, no file edits, no "small fixes while I'm in there."
Never echo secret values — keys, tokens, passwords, connection strings — in plans, reports, code comments, or logs. Reference by name only.
No scope creep. Do exactly what the prompt says, nothing extra. Adjacent bugs or improvements get REPORTED, not fixed, unless the prompt covers them.
Ambiguity = stop and ask. If any instruction could be read two ways, present the readings and wait. Guessing wrong on an external action is worse than asking.
Every completion report must state: what changed (files), what external actions were taken (each one traceable to an explicit instruction), what was deliberately NOT done, and npm run build status.
10. Plaid connections are untouchable. Never create, delete, re-link, rotate, or modify Plaid Items, link tokens, access tokens, or Plaid credentials. Never write to plaid_items or plaid_accounts beyond what existing, already-approved sync code does. Never call Plaid endpoints that create or remove Items. The owner has a limited number of connections; any action that could consume, invalidate, or disconnect one is owner-only, always, regardless of any other instruction.
11. Mobile-first verification. The owner uses the app on a phone. Any UI change must be verified rendered at mobile width (≤390px) before being reported complete. A feature that works only at desktop width is not complete. Completion reports must state what was visually verified at mobile width, not what the code should do.
